Proxy server for TMDB API

This project previously embedded the TMDB API key in the frontend bundle (VITE_API_KEY), which exposes the key in browser DevTools. To secure the key, a small proxy server is added that stores the TMDB key on the server and forwards requests to TMDB.

Files added/changed:
- server/index.js: Express proxy that forwards /api/* to TMDB and injects the API key from server environment variables.
- .gitignore: .env and .history added.
- Various client hooks/components updated to call /api/* instead of including the API key.

Quick start (local):
1. Create a server .env file at project root or set environment variable TMDB_API_KEY (do NOT commit):

   TMDB_API_KEY=your_real_tmdb_api_key_here

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Run both server and Vite dev concurrently:

```powershell
npm run dev:server
```

This runs the Express proxy on port 5000 and Vite on its default port. Client requests to `/api/...` will be proxied through the server and the API key will not be included in the client bundle.

If you prefer to run separately:

```powershell
# Run server only
node server/index.js
# Run client only
npm run dev
```

Cleaning up leaked keys:
- Remove `.env` from git index and add to .gitignore. Rotate (replace) the TMDB API key in TMDB dashboard if it was committed to remote history.

If you want, I can also:
- Run the git removal steps to remove `.env` from history (requires your confirmation due to force-push implications).
- Automatically rotate keys (not possible programmatically here; done in TMDB dashboard).
